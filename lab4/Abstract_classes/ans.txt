In Java, a class cannot be both abstract and final because these two keywords have contradictory meanings:

abstract: This keyword indicates that the class is incomplete and must be subclassed. 
        It can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses.

final: This keyword indicates that the class cannot be subclassed. 
        It is a complete class, and no other class can extend it.

Since an abstract class is meant to be extended and a final class cannot be extended, combining these two keywords would create a logical contradiction. Therefore, Java does not allow a class to be both abstract and final.
